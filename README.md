<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In this project we will implement the Variable Elimination algorithm for inference on a given probabilistic graphical model.
The algorithm is as follows :-
![Variable Elimination algorithm](https://github.com/Shivvrat/Variable-Elimination/blob/master/ve.png)

### Built With

* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)


## Getting Started

Lets see how to run this program on a local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following modules 
```
import sys
import warnings
from math import log10 , exp 4
import numpy
```
### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Shivvrat/Variable-Elimination.git
```
Use the main.py to run the algorithm.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Please enter the following command line argument :-
```
python main.py <uai_file_name > <evidence_file_name >
```
Please use the following command line parameters for the main.py file :-

• ```<uai_file_directory_and_name>```
Please provide the file that will be used as the .uai file

• ```<evidence_file_directory_and_name>```
Please provide the file that will be used as the uai.evid file
